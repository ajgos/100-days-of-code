#  100-days-of-code

#### My take on the 100 days of code challenge.

I plan to do complete at least one challenge every day for the next 100 days in Javascript as well as Java.
The questions and the solutions are in the table below.

| Day | Question | Difficulty Level | Concepts | Solution in Java | Solution in Javascript |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | [Count occurrences of Anagrams](Day%201%5CProblem) | Easy | HashMaps, Arrays, Sliding Window | [Solution](Day%201%5Csolution.java) | [Solution](Day%201%5Csolution.js) |
